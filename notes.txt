(Helpful formulas I found on internet):

(I will need to compile game data for both AD and Timmy for this --- maybe a small sample space as well but well see)
PIE Formula=(PTS + FGM + FTM – FGA – FTA + Deff.REB + Off.REB/2 + AST + STL + BLK/2 – PF – TO) / (Game.PTS + Game.FGM + Game.FTM – Game.FGA – Game.FTA + Game.Deff.REB + Game.Off.REB/2 + Game.AST + Game.STL + Game.BLK/2 – Game.PF – Game.TO)

Possesions (TmPoss) = .5 * (FGA + .475 * FTA - ORB + TOV)
Estimates number of possessions a team has in a game/season; Substitute Opponents' totals to get their number of possessions (OppPoss)

Offensive Rating (OR) = 100 / (TmPoss + OppPoss) * Pts
Defensive Rating (DR) = 100 / (TmPoss + OppPoss) * OppPts
Adjusts a team's scoring offense and defense for their pace of play, allows you to better compare a team like Wisconsin to a team like Duke

Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%) = (FG + .5 * 3P) / FGA
Adjusts a player's or team's FG% for the fact that a 3 pointer is worth 1.5 times a standard FG

True Shooting Percentage (TS%) = Pts / (2 * (FGA + .475 * FTA))
Adjusts standard FG% to include their FT%, encompasses all ways to score (my preferred shooting % stat)

Free Throw Rate (FTR) = FT / FGA
A measure of both how often a player/team gets to the line, as well as how often they make their free throws

Offensive Rebounding Percentage (ORB%) = ORB / MP / (TmORB + OppDRB) * TmMP / 5
Defensive Rebounding Percentage (DRB%) = DRB / MP / (TmDRB + OppORB) * TmMP / 5
Total Rebounding Percentage (TRB%) = TRB / MP / (TmTRB + OppTRB) * TmMP / 5
Measures the percentage of the available rebounds a player grabs at the offensive and defensive ends of the floor while he is in the game. TRB% measures the total rebounds he grabs of those available while he is in the game.

Hollinger Assist Ratio (hAST%) = AST / (FGA + .475 * FTA + AST + TOV)
Think of Carmelo Anthony for this statistic, it is a "ball stopper" stat. This divides the number of assists a player has by the number of offensive possessions that end in that player's hands.

Pomeroy Assist Ratio (pAST%) = AST / (((MP / (TmMP / 5)) * TmFG ) - FG)
The percentage of teammate baskets a player assisted on while he was on the court - my preferred Assists statistic

Assists per Team Possession (AST/p%) = AST / ((MP / (TmMP / 5)) * TmPoss)
Adjusts pAST% to account for pace of play; penalizes player for teammate mistakes (TOV, missed FGA)

Steal Percentage (STL%) = STL / ((MP / (TmMP / 5)) * OppPoss)
Percent of opponent possessions in which a player gets a steal

Block Percentage (BLK%) = BLK / ((MP / (TmMP / 5 )) * (OppFGA - Opp3PA))
Percent of opponents' "blockable" shots that the player blocks (removes 3 point shots, as these are generally not "blockable", somewhat arbitrary since you see these blocked and a mid range jump shot is just as unlikely to be blocked, yet is included in the sample)

Turnover Percentage (TOV%) = TOV / (FGA + .475*FTA + AST + TOV)
Percent of a player's possessions that ends in turnovers, essentially the same as the hAST% equation, but for turnovers rather than assists
